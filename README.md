Joint Access Mesh Networks
What is Janmesh? What is a Janmesh box?
Janmesh (SSID http://janmesh.net) is a citizen-to-citizen networking initiative, running nodes with an active CoOoOW stack (cjdns over OLSRD over open WiFi), that provide an alternative communication medium resistant to severely communication network-disruptive situations.
A Janmesh box is a computing device (typically an unexpensive SoC/SbC computing device, or an old laptop) running as a Janmesh network node, connected to neighbourhood's nodes, and serving mesh connectivity and services toward the home LAN network
How is the Janmesh Project doing?
A full documentation to get a working CoOoOW stack with basic Ubuntu GNU/Linux computers is available. The network is up and runing at a local scale
Documentation and tutorials
Beginner
Read how to connect two machines in mesh mode, using their wifi links and a CoOoOw stack, from scratch, using GUI tools ; or, to add a new machine to your existing mesh network using command line. Then, learn more about firefall to secure (network) access to your devices. .
Intermediate
Lear how to use one machine that operate Janmesh over Wifi and that is connected to Internet through Ethernet to act as a gateway and NAT box in order to allow other devices with (meshing) wifi only to share its Internet access. 
MCPae
The software that is meant to be run on meshboxes, developed by the Janmesh Project, is called MCPae. It is not available for download for now, but there is some documentation about it.
